/*
 * External libraries -- Static Linking
 * (against the binary)
 * For libary "glf_w"
 * 
 * HEre the idea is that all the libraries 
 * are here. On the local. No external packages 
 * no external libraries
 * 
 * For C++ clone repo -- compile/run
 * Keep the versions of libraries in the actual repo
 * 
 * For serious projects building the source code 
 * of libraries is bettern, then linking with binaries
 * This can be done by adding another project and 
 * compiling it into a static or dynamic library
 * 
 * Linking against binaries is simpler and faster 
 * (less reliable)
 * Here this is considered.
 * 
 * For linux most libraries are not available 
 * in binaries
 * 
 * Existis static and dynamic libraries
 * 
 * Static libaby -- the libary is inside the executable (faster)
 * Dynamic libary -- linked at runtime (sometimes forced)
 * 
 * .dll dynamic link library
 * 
 * Here the lecutre is based on GFW library 
 * that exists only for Windows. 
 * All the examples are for Visual Studio setup
 * 
 * I cannot replicate it
